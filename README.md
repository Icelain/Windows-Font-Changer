# Windows-Font-Changer
A registry handler in python that changes the font of your windows 10 pc.
-No external libraries required.
-If compiling into executable, be sure to place d.txt and h.reg into the same directory as main.exe.
-This might also work on Windows 8.1(not tested though!).

The build is available as a github release because out of the blue some people are trying to use this old script
